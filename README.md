<h2>Duck</h2>
<p>
    The Duck project is an interactive web application that simulates a duck swimming against the backdrop of moving clouds.
    The main feature of the project is its visual component. The background image is a sky with clouds moving in different directions. The duck floating on the surface of the water has live animation.
